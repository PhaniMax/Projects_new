# ü¶† Malaria Parasite Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting malaria-infected cells and classifying parasite types using a two-stage deep learning approach. It aims to assist healthcare professionals with faster and more accurate diagnostics in resource-constrained environments.

---

## üìå Project Overview

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. Early detection plays a key role in treatment and prevention.  
In this project, we build a **two-stage deep learning pipeline**:

1. **Stage 1** ‚Äì Detect whether a cell is infected or uninfected.  
2. **Stage 2** ‚Äì If infected, classify the type of malaria parasite.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [NIH Malaria Dataset](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/pubs/MalariaDatasets.html)  
- The dataset contains over 27,000 cell images ‚Äî split into:
  - Parasitized (infected)
  - Uninfected

Each image is 3-channel RGB and approximately 128x128 pixels.

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Stage 1**: Binary Classification  
  - CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers  
  - Output: Infected / Uninfected

- **Stage 2**: Multi-Class Classification  
  - Another CNN for parasite classification  
  - Output: Specific parasite type (if applicable)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **Tools**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
